This project is a console-based trading application implemented in C++. It allows users to register as traders, log in, and place buy or sell orders for stocks. The system manages traders, their balances, and their order history. Admins can log in to add new stocks
and view registered traders. Traders can view available stocks, create orders, and check their order history and account balances. The application uses classes to encapsulate trader and stock details, with an overarching TradingApp class to handle
core functionalities like authentication, stock management, and order processing. This project demonstrates object-oriented programming, data encapsulation, and basic trading operations.
